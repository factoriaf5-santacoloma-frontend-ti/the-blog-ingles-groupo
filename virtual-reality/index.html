    <h2 id="what-is-vr">What is Virtual Reality?</h2>
    <p>Virtual Reality (VR) is a simulated experience that can either mirror the real world or create a completely new and immersive environment. Unlike traditional interfaces, VR places the user inside an experience. Instead of viewing a screen in front of them, users are immersed in 3D worlds, interacting with the environment in a way that feels natural.</p>

    <p><strong>Here are the key features of virtual reality:</strong></p>
  
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Immersive Experience:</strong> VR provides a full 360-degree view, making users feel as if they are physically present within the virtual world.
           
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Interactive:</strong> VR environments allow users to interact with objects and surroundings in real-time.

        <li>
            <strong>Simulated Environment:</strong> The entire world is computer-generated, from landscapes to objects, and can be altered dynamically.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="how-it-works">How Does Virtual Reality Work?</h2>
    <p>The magic of VR lies in its ability to trick the brain into perceiving a virtual environment as reality. This is achieved through several technologies working together:</p>
    <img src="how-work.jpg" alt="" width=200>
    
    <h3>1. Headset (HMD – Head-Mounted Display)</h3>
    <p>The VR headset is the most critical piece of equipment. It displays stereoscopic images to create depth perception and tracks the user’s head movements, allowing the environment to change based on where the user is looking.</p>

    <h3 id="motion-tracking">2. Motion Tracking</h3>
    <p>Motion tracking enables the system to track the user's movements in 3D space. It includes head, hand, and sometimes body movement to create a highly interactive experience.</p>

    <h3>3. Input Devices</h3>
    <p>Hand controllers, gloves, or other input devices are used to interact with objects in the virtual world, enhancing the overall immersive experience.</p>

    <h2 id="applications">Applications of Virtual Reality</h2>
    <p>VR is being used across various industries. Here are some of its key applications:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Gaming and Entertainment:</strong> VR gaming offers immersive experiences where players interact with the game world. Popular games include <em>Beat Saber</em> and <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em>.
           
        </li>
        <img src="Virtual-Reality-Gaming.jpg" alt="" width=200>
        <li>
            <strong>Education and Training:</strong> VR enables students and professionals to learn in simulated environments. Medical students, for example, can perform virtual surgeries.
            
        </li>
        <img src="educationvr.jpeg" alt="" width=200>
        <li>
            <strong>Healthcare:</strong> VR is used for therapy, such as treating PTSD, and in physical rehabilitation to help patients recover motor skills.
            
        </li>
        <img src="virtualdoc.jpg" alt="" width=200>
        <li>
            <strong>Architecture and Real Estate:</strong> Architects and buyers can explore virtual buildings before construction or purchase.
           
        </li>
